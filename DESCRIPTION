Description: Provides a suite of functions for analyzing sequences of events. Users can generate and code sequences based on predefined rules, with a special focus on the identification of sequences coded as 'ABA' (when one element appears, followed by a different one, and then followed by the first). Additionally, the package offers the ability to calculate the length of consecutive 'ABA'-coded sequences sharing common elements. The methods implemented in this package are based on the work by Ziembowicz, K., Rychwalska, A., & Nowak, A. (2022). <doi:10.1177/10464964221118674>.
